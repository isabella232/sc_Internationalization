➠1 - Internationalization

👯JESSY😺 Hello, iOS developer friends! Jessy here!
👯CATIE🐸 Catie *here*!
👯JESSY😺 In this screencast, we are going to show you how to support multiple languages in your app.
👯CATIE🐸 For that, there are two main things that you need to take care of: Internationalization and Localization. 


➠😺JESSY😺  
Internationalization is the task of getting your app *ready* for supporting multiple languages. One thing this will involve is setting up Auto Layout so that your text will support strings of any length. You'll also extract text strings from your app so that text is not hardcoded.

Localization is the task of translating your app for a specific language or region.

In this screencast, we'll be covering only the Internationalization side of things. We'll cover Localization in another screencast.

As you see, the UI for *MyFriend* already uses Auto Layout, and so, does not need any further work. But if your app does not use Auto Layout, your first step in the quest for internationalization would be to add Auto Layout support. We have a couple of video courses on Auto Layout if you need to learn about it.

The next step is to go through your code and get any user-facing text ready for localization.

All new Xcode projects are preconfigured to support internationalization. So, your storyboards always are set for Base internationalization, supporting the user's development language as the default language. In our case, the development language was English. For you, it might be something else.

After you've extracted the storyboard text, it's time to work with the strings in your Swift code!

For a small project like *MyFriend*, you could simply go through your text and replace the string values by hand, as we showed.

But what if you have tens or hundreds of files, in a large project, where each file has thousands of lines of code? Fortunately, there's another way to handle this.


➠Conclusion
That’s everything I we would like to cover in this screencast regarding internationalization. Your project is now ready to be localized.

By now you should have a good idea of how to take any iOS project and set it up for supporting multiple languages. 

While this won't make you a suave international man (or woman) of mystery, it will certainly help you make an app that appeals to a lot more people since it will speak their language!

Do take a look at our other screencasts if you are interested in learning more about Internationlization or any other mobile development related topics.

Adios, Ciao, and see ya!
